Subject: ANNOUNCE: xpdf 0.7a - a PDF viewer for X


I've just released a new version of xpdf, my Portable Document Format
(PDF) viewer for X.

Xpdf runs under the X Window System on Unix, VMS, and OS/2.

!!! Please note my new email/web/ftp addresses. !!!

This is primiarily a bug fix release.  The most noticeable changes
are:

* Moved find command from menu to toolbar button.
* Support TrueColor visuals and private colormaps.
* Mouse button 2 pans the window.
* Selecting a URI link now executes a configurable command (e.g.,
  telling a browser to open a web page).
* Added a "link info" display which shows the URL or file for the link
  under the mouse.
* Fixed double-draw text problem with Acrobat Capture output.
* Recognize all PDF 1.2 operators.
* Added option for A4 paper (for PostScript output).
* External Type 1 font files are now embedded.
* Added option to generate Level 1 PostScript.
* Now uses an autoconf script (instead of the kludgey
  Makefile.config).
* Lots of other little things (see the `CHANGES' file) 

I'm particularly interested in feedback on the new configure script,
since I've only tested it on my own system.

I have decryption code, but I'm not releasing it until I figure out
how to get around the U.S. export restrictions.

Source (C++ and C) is available, and it should be fairly easy to
compile for UNIX, VMS, or OS/2.

More information, source code, and precompiled binaries are at:

  ftp://ftp.aimnet.com/pub/users/derekn/xpdf/

Source and Linux binaries are on sunsite.unc.edu, currently in
/pub/Linux/Incoming but they will be moved to:

  ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/graphics/viewers/X
