Subject: ANNOUNCE: xpdf 0.6 - a PDF viewer for X


I've just released a new version of xpdf, my Portable Document Format
(PDF) viewer for X.

If you've wanted to look at PDF files, but couldn't because Adobe
didn't have a viewer for your system, you'll want to check out xpdf.

Changes in version 0.6:

* Basic support for PDF 1.2 files
* Better font support
* Print directly from xpdf -- '|lpr'
* Fixed links between files
* Fixed several bugs in PostScript output
* Lots of other little things (see the `CHANGES' file) 

(I have decryption code, but I'm not releasing it until I figure out
how to get around the U.S. export restrictions.)

Source (C++ and C) is available, and it should be fairly easy to
compile for UNIX or VMS.

Binaries are available for:

* Linux 2.0 ELF (x86)
* AIX 4.1 (PowerPC)
* SunOS 4.1 (SPARC)
* Ultrix 4.4 (MIPS)
* OSF/1 3.2 (Alpha)
* HP-UX 9.05 (HP-PA)

More information, source code, and precompiled binaries are at:

  http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/usr/dn0o/xpdf/xpdf.html
  ftp://ftp.andrew.cmu.edu/pub/xpdf/

Source and Linux binaries are on sunsite.unc.edu, currently in
/pub/Linux/Incoming but they will be moved to:

  ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/X11/xapps/graphics/viewers/
