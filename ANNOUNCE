Subject: ANNOUNCE: Xpdf 1.00 - a PDF viewer for X


I've just released a new version of Xpdf, my Portable Document Format
(PDF) viewer for X.

Xpdf runs under the X Window System on Unix, VMS, and OS/2.  The non-X
components of the package (pdftops, pdftotext, etc.) also run on Win32
systems.

WARNING: Xpdf 1.x uses a completely different config file setup than
Xpdf 0.9x.  Please see the "Upgrading from Xpdf 0.9x" section in the
README file.

Noticeable changes:
* Completely rewrote the code that handles font encodings:
  - everything is Unicode-based
  - 16-bit fonts are handled much more cleanly
  - text output encoding can be set more flexibly
* New .xpdfrc config files.
* Implemented the sh (shaded fill) operator for the axial shading
  type.
* Added a duplex option to PSOutputDev and a -duplex switch to
  pdftops.
* Added key bindings for forward ('v') and backward ('b').
* Added the pdffonts program which lists the fonts used in a PDF
  file.
* Fixed several problems in the TrueType font embedding code (for
  PostScript output).
* Accept named destination on command line.
* Added several new items to pdfinfo: file size, PDF version, tagged
  (yes or no), XML metadata (with the -meta option).

See the `CHANGES' file for a complete list.

Source (C++ and C) is available, and it should be fairly easy to
compile for UNIX, VMS, OS/2, and Win32.

More information, source code, and precompiled binaries are on the
xpdf web page and ftp site:

    http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/
    ftp://ftp.foolabs.com/pub/xpdf/

Source and Linux binaries are on sunsite.unc.edu, currently in
the incoming directory, but they will be moved to:

    ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/apps/graphics/viewers/X
