Subject: ANNOUNCE: xpdf 0.7 - a PDF viewer for X


I've just released a new version of xpdf, my Portable Document Format
(PDF) viewer for X.

Xpdf runs under the X Window System on Unix, VMS, and OS/2.

Changes in version 0.7:

* Implemented FlateDecode filter (for PDF 1.2)
* Basic xref table reconstruction for damaged files
* New pdftotext program converts PDF to plain text
* Added open and save functions; allow xpdf to start without any PDF
  file.
* Implemented text find.
* Implemented text select/copy.
* Change mouse cursor when it's over a link.
* Embed Type 1 fonts in PostScript output.
* Lots of other little things (see the `CHANGES' file) 

(I have decryption code, but I'm not releasing it until I figure out
how to get around the U.S. export restrictions.)

Source (C++ and C) is available, and it should be fairly easy to
compile for UNIX, VMS, or OS/2.

Binaries are available for:

* Linux 2.0 ELF (x86)
* AIX 4.1 (PowerPC)
* SunOS 4.1 (SPARC)
* OSF/1 3.2 (Alpha)
* HP-UX 9.05 (HP-PA)

More information, source code, and precompiled binaries are at:

  ftp://ftp.andrew.cmu.edu/pub/xpdf/

Source and Linux binaries are on sunsite.unc.edu, currently in
/pub/Linux/Incoming but they will be moved to:

  ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/X11/xapps/graphics/viewers/
