0.2 (95-dec-12)
---------------
First public release.


0.3 (96-jan-13)
---------------
LZW patent workaround.
Implemented inline images.
Fixed (mostly) disjoint polygon fills.
Added remote server stuff.
Added page number on command line.
Fixed problem with font encodings which caused character misalignment.
Fixed inverted CCITT decoding and inverted image mask drawing.
Now compiles under gcc 2.7.x (ignore those stupid 'unused parameter'
  warnings).
Many minor bug fixes and optimizations.


0.4 (96-apr-24)
---------------
Implemented DCT filter.
Implemented PostScript output; wrote pdftops program.
Implemented links.
Implemented font rotation -- I was wrong: X11R6 servers *do* support
  font rotation (by specifying a matrix in place of a size).
Added bindings for Home/End, Page Up/Down, arrow keys.
Added initialZoom resource and -z option.
Added geometry resource and -g option.
Fixed image size off-by-one bug.
Fixed bug where page content is reference to an array of streams.
Cleaned up uninitialized variables which were causing random problems
  on various platforms.
Manually skip whitespace before calling atoi() for startxref.
Replaced calls to XrmCombineFileDatabase() with calls to
  XrmGetFileDatabase() and XrmMergeDatabases() so it will work under
  older versions of X.
Fixed problem with reading multiple xref tables in updated PDF files.
Check for encryption and print appropriate error message.
Rudimentary dithering of images.
Fixed buf in CCITTFax filter (pass mode followed by horizontal mode).
Optimized drawImage() and drawImageMask().
Changed several things to ease porting:
  - changed '__inline' to 'inline' (to adhere to the ANSI standard)
  - surrounded interface/implementation pragmas with #ifdef _GNUC__
  - got rid of empty array initializer lists
  - moved Operator type definition from Gfx.cc to Gfx.h
  - renamed String, uint, etc.
  - ability to uncompress to file (NO_POPEN and USE_GZIP flags)
  - added definitions of XK_Page_Up/Down and XPointer for old versions
    of X
For VMS port:
  - use correct Xdefaults name for VMS, get rid of ltkGetHomeDir()
  - added '#include <stddef.h>' before all X includes
  - renamed files with multiple periods in their names
Fixed window resizing infinite oscillation bug.
Fixed problem with string-type (as opposed to stream-type) indexed
  color space lookup tables (which are used in inline images).
If an X font is not found, try smaller and then larger sizes (this is
  useful for old or broken X servers which can't scale bitmap fonts).
Added -rgb (color cube size) option.
Various minor bug fixes.
