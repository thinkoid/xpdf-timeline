0.2 (95-dec-12)
---------------
First public release.


0.3 (96-jan-13)
---------------
LZW patent workaround.
Implemented inline images.
Fixed (mostly) disjoint polygon fills.
Added remote server stuff.
Added page number on command line.
Fixed problem with font encodings which caused character misalignment.
Fixed inverted CCITT decoding and inverted image mask drawing.
Now compiles under gcc 2.7.x (ignore those stupid 'unused parameter'
  warnings).
Many minor bug fixes and optimizations.


0.4 (96-apr-24)
---------------
Implemented DCT filter.
Implemented PostScript output; wrote pdftops program.
Implemented links.
Implemented font rotation -- I was wrong: X11R6 servers *do* support
  font rotation (by specifying a matrix in place of a size).
Added bindings for Home/End, Page Up/Down, arrow keys.
Added initialZoom resource and -z option.
Added geometry resource and -g option.
Fixed image size off-by-one bug.
Fixed bug where page content is reference to an array of streams.
Cleaned up uninitialized variables which were causing random problems
  on various platforms.
Manually skip whitespace before calling atoi() for startxref.
Replaced calls to XrmCombineFileDatabase() with calls to
  XrmGetFileDatabase() and XrmMergeDatabases() so it will work under
  older versions of X.
Fixed problem with reading multiple xref tables in updated PDF files.
Check for encryption and print appropriate error message.
Rudimentary dithering of images.
Fixed bug in CCITTFax filter (pass mode followed by horizontal mode).
Optimized drawImage() and drawImageMask().
Changed several things to ease porting:
  - changed '__inline' to 'inline' (to adhere to the ANSI standard)
  - surrounded interface/implementation pragmas with #ifdef _GNUC__
  - got rid of empty array initializer lists
  - moved Operator type definition from Gfx.cc to Gfx.h
  - renamed String, uint, etc.
  - ability to uncompress to file (NO_POPEN and USE_GZIP flags)
  - added definitions of XK_Page_Up/Down and XPointer for old versions
    of X
For VMS port:
  - use correct Xdefaults name for VMS, get rid of ltkGetHomeDir()
  - added '#include <stddef.h>' before all X includes
  - renamed files with multiple periods in their names
Fixed window resizing infinite oscillation bug.
Fixed problem with string-type (as opposed to stream-type) indexed
  color space lookup tables (which are used in inline images).
If an X font is not found, try smaller and then larger sizes (this is
  useful for old or broken X servers which can't scale bitmap fonts).
Added -rgb (color cube size) option.
Various minor bug fixes.


0.5 (96-may-23)
---------------
Fixed bug in LTKWindow which broke the remote server mode.
Fixed PostScript output:
  - doesn't seg fault if file is unwritable.
  - incorrect DSC comment - need colon in '%%Page:'.
  - use 'imagemask' command for masks.
  - output filters in the correct order.
  - Stream::isBinary() checks the next-to-bottom, not top, stream.
  - if page width > height, rotate it 90 degrees.
  - if page is larger than paper size, scale it down.
Set default MediaBox to 8.5" x 11" to deal with non-compliant PDF
  files which don't specify a MediaBox.
Added DEBUG_MEM stuff in gmem.c and gmempp.cc.
Fixed memory leaks:
  - LTKWindow didn't delete the LTKBox.
  - LinkAction needs a virtual destructor.
Use $(RANLIB) variable in goo/Makefile and ltk/Makefile.
Allocate image data after calling XCreateImage, using
  image->bytes_per_line -- works in 24-bit mode now.
DCTStream rounds width of rowBuf lines up to the next multiple of
  mcuWidth, so last MCU doesn't run off end of buffer.
Increase size of block (from 255 to 1024 bytes) read at end of file to
  search for 'startxref'.
Skip past garbage at start of file, look for '%PDF'.
Moved more compiler options out of Makefiles into Makefile.config.
Top-level Makefile uses '$(MAKE)' instead of 'make' for making
  subdirectories.
Space/PageDown/Next and Backspace/PageUp/Previous now moves to
  next/previous page if already scrolled to bottom/top of current
  page.


0.5a (96-jul-09)
----------------
[not a public release]
For PDF 1.2 (a.k.a. Amber, a.k.a. Acrobat 3) support:
  - look for trailer after first xref instead of at end of file.
Deal with font subsets by converting character names of the form
  'Cnnnn' to the appropriate character from the standard encoding.
Extract encoding from embedded Type 1 fonts.
Kludge to fill one-pixel thick polygons.
Changed X font encoding to use endash for hyphen (gets rid of too-long
  hyphens).
Handle Resources key in Pages dictionaries (needed for pstoedit
  output).
Fix comment handling in Parser (needed for pstoedit output).
Move Bezier curve conversion from GfxState to XOutputDev; look at
  flatness parameter in GfxState.
Change all of the path functions in XOutputDev (stroke, fill, clip) to
  use the same path transformation/conversion function.
Rewrote PostScript output driver as a subclass of OutputDev; removed
  duplicated code (ps_ functions) from Gfx.
Fixed bug in xref code with small (< 1024 bytes) PDF files.
Implemented BX/EX operators.
Added PDFDoc class.


0.6 (96-nov-12)
---------------
Add support for PostScript output to stdout (-) and to a command
  (|lpr); added -ps option and psFile resource.
Decryption is implemented but not included in the distribution due to
  legal restrictions: the decryption algorithm is a trade secret of
  RSA, Inc., and the U.S.A. still has bogus export controls on
  cryptography software.
Added .xpdfrc config file:
  - Added fontmap parameter: user can map PDF font names to X fonts.
  - Added fontpath parameter: search for Type 1 font if encoding is
    not in PDF file.
Incremental display: display is updated after every 200 commands.
Added forward and backward by-10-page buttons.
Links:
  - Implement links with "Launch" actions that point to PDF files.
  - Draw borders around links.
  - Handle links with named destinations.
  - GoToR links specify a page number instead of a page reference.
Optimizations:
  - Rewrote Stream to use buffering, and added lookChar() functions;
    rewrote Lexer to take advantage of this.
  - Use hash tables for name->code mapping in font encodings.
  - Made XOutputDev::doCurve() iterative, changed /2 to *0.5, and
    changed the flatness test.
Added file name to window title.
Implemented RunLength filter.
Implemented forms.
Convert ObjType to an enum.
Changed isDict("Pages") to isDict() (in Catalog.cc) to deal with
  incorrect PDF files.
Changed color selection so that very pale colors don't map to white.
Fixed bug in CCITTFax filter (multiple make-up codes).
In GString::clear(): need to set length to 0 before calling resize().
Base initial window size on first displayed page, not page 1; deal
  correctly with rotated pages.
Added ltkGetIntResource() and LTKApp::getIntResource().
PostScript output fixes:
  - Escape backslashes in strings.
  - When doing ASCII85 encoding, keep both chars of EOF marker ('~>')
    on same line.
  - Add extra line '%-EOD-' after image data streams; call wrapper
    functions for image and imagemask which look for this line -- this
    should fix the 'too much data in stream' bug.
  - Font tags can be reused for different fonts on different pages --
    so use font object reference (number/generation) instead.
Initialize character widths to zero (this caused crashes on OSF/1).
Handle image masks which go outside of pixmap.
Makefile.config changes:
  - Remove -o in C++ compile rule.
  - Add $(AR) variable.
Code which read char widths from font dictionary read all but the last
  width.
Add 'return 0;' to main() in xpdf and pdftops.
Allow fonts to use StandardEncoding.
Convert man pages to VMS help files.

0.7 (97-may-28)
---------------
Implemented FlateDecode filter (for PDF 1.2).
Basic xref table reconstruction for damaged files
New pdftotext program converts PDF to plain text.
Implemented menus in LTK; added a menu to xpdf.
Added open and save functions; allow xpdf to start without any PDF
  file.
Implemented text find.
Implemented text select/copy.
Change mouse cursor when it's over a link.
Embed Type 1 fonts in PostScript output.
Moved rotate functions to menu; added quit to menu.
Fixed stroke color bug in PostScript output (was using fill color
  instead of stroke color; this sometimes caused lines to be missing
  (white) in PostScript output).
Support Launch-type links -- pops up a dialog before executing
  anything.  Expects the A (action) dictionary to contain a Unix
  dictionary with F (file) and P (paremeter) keys just like the Win
  dictionary.
A moveto op all by itself should just be discarded, instead of
  generating a subpath with one point (this was causing seg faults).
Balanced parentheses in strings don't need to be escaped.
Tj operator in PostScript prolog didn't check for zero when dividing
  by length of string.
Implemented selection in LTK; TextIn widgets support dragging/copy/
  paste.
Handle font subsets that use hex character codes.
Added icon pixmap; added the XPMLIB and NO_XPM variables to
  Makefile.config.
Fixed subtle bug in use of horizontal scaling parameter (it affects
  only the width of drawn characters, not positioning done in text
  space).
Memory testing (with DEBUG_MEM):
  - gmalloc now fills memory blocks with garbage to catch unitialized
    fields.
  - gfree fills memory blocks with garbage to catch uses of freed
    blocks.
Handle image masks which go off the pixmap on the top and/or left.
Fixed inline functions which had two return statements (to make the
  HP, SCO, and other cfront-based compilers happy).
Fixed bug which caused seg faults when following a link to a different
  file (info in LinkGoto object was used after link was deleted by
  loadFile).
If page content is an array of streams, the streams are concatenated;
  objects and commands can span multiple streams.
If file open fails, try lower-casing and upper-casing the file name.
Commands should end when lexer sees a '/' character.
GString::append(char *, int) was broken.
Changed LTKScrollingCanvas redraw to be more efficient: copy as much
  as possible from window before copying from off-screen pixmap.
Ignore gs (set extended graphics state) operator.
Handle colorspaces (CalGray/RGB are treated as DeviceGray/RGB; the
  weird colorspaces are not yet implemented).
Named destinations (for links) can be strings as well as names; deal
  with the names tree in the catalog.
Clip to the page CropBox.
Added '-q' to gzip options (to suppress warnings, in case user has -v
  in GZIP env var).
Added 'include Makefile.config' to top-level Makefile.
Added INSTALL variable to Makefile.config; used in top-level
  Makefile.
Always initialize LinkDest left/bottom/top/right/zoom fields (bogus
  floating point values were causing crashes on Alpha).
Added Makefile.config options for Digital Unix (DEC compilers), HP-UX
  (HP compilers), SCO Unix, and Evans & Sutherland ES/OS.
Added flag to set stream mode in fopen call for VMS.
Rewrote Link module.
Pages with no contents shouldn't cause an error message.
In PostScript output: pdfImM needs to set fill color before doing
  imagemask.
If font doesn't specify character widths, use widths from built-in
  font, based on font flags.
Fixed LTK scrollbar to delay before repeating and to control the
  period between repeats.
Removed window/widget copy() methods (they were untested and unused).
Unknown filter types produce a single error message instead of a
  stream of errors.
Added a dummy target in top-level Makefile so making individual
  executables (e.g., 'make pdftops') should now work.
Added optional xpdf-flip.ltk with buttons on right side instead of
  bottom of window.
