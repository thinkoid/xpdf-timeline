.SH NAME
xpdf \- Portable Document Format (PDF) file viewer for X (version 0.6)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xpdf
[options]
.RI [ PDF-file
.RI [ page ]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Xpdf
is a viewer for Portable Document Format (PDF) files.  (These are also
sometimes also called \'Acrobat' files, from the name of Adobe's PDF
software.)  Xpdf runs under UNIX or VMS and the X Window System.
.PP
To run xpdf, simply type:
.PP
.RS
xpdf file.pdf
.RE
.PP
where
.I file.pdf
is your PDF file.  The file name can be followed by a number
specifying the page which should be displayed first, e.g.:
.PP
.RS
xpdf file.pdf 18
.RE
.SH OPTIONS
X resources are listed in square brackets with the corresponding
option.
.TP
.B \-err
Send error messages to /dev/tty instead of stderr (useful if xpdf is
started from another application, e.g., netscape which otherwise pops
up an annoying little window for every error).
.TP
.BI \-z " number"
Set the initial zoom factor (-5 .. 5).
.RB [ xpdf.initialZoom ]
.TP
.BI \-g " geometry"
Set the initial window geometry.
.RB ( \-geometry
is equivalent.)
.RB [ xpdf.geometry ]
.TP
.BI \-remote " name"
Start/contact xpdf remote server with specified name (see the
.B "REMOTE SERVER MODE"
section below).
.TP
.B \-raise
Raise xpdf remote server window (with -remote only).
.TP
.B \-quit
Kill xpdf remote server (with -remote only).
.TP
.BI \-rgb " number"
Set the size of largest RGB cube xpdf will try to allocate.  The
default is 5 (for a 5x5x5 cube); set to a smaller number to conserve
color table entries.
.TP
.BI \-ps " PS-file"
Set the default file name for PostScript output.  This can also be of
the form \'|command' to pipe the PostScript through a command.
.RB [ xpdf.psFile ]
.TP
.B \-cmd
Print commands as they're executed (useful for debugging).
.TP
.B \-h
Print usage information.
.RB ( \-help
is equivalent.)
.PP
Several other standard X options and resources will work as expected:
.TP
.BI \-display " display"
.RB [ xpdf.display ]
.TP
.BI \-fg " color"
.RB ( \-foreground
is equivalent.)
.RB [ xpdf.foreground ]
.TP
.BI \-bg " color"
.RB ( \-background
is equivalent.)
.RB [ xpdf.background ]
.TP
.BI \-font " font"
.RB ( \-fn
is equivalent.)
.RB [ xpdf.font ]
.PP
The color and font options only affect the user interface elements,
not the PDF display (the \'paper').
.SH CONTROLS
.SS On-screen controls, at the bottom of the xpdf window
.TP
.B "left/right arrow buttons"
Move to the previous/next page.
.TP
.B "double left/right arrow buttons"
Move backward or forward by ten pages.
.TP
.B "\'Page' entry box"
Move to a specific page number.  Click in the box to activate it, type
the page number, then hit return.
.TP
.B "magnifying glass buttons"
Increase and decrease the resolution, i.e., zoom in and zoom out.
.TP
.B "print button"
Bring up a dialog for generating a PostScript file.  The dialog has
options to set the pages to be printed and the PostScript file name.
The file name can be \'-' for stdout or \'|command' to pipe the
PostScript through a command, e.g., \'|lpr'.
.TP
.B "curved arrow buttons"
Rotate the page clockwise and counterclockwise.  These are intended
primarily for PDF files where the rotation isn't correctly specified
in the file, but they're also useful if your X server doesn't support
font rotation.
.TP
.B "\'?' button"
Bring up the \'about xpdf' window.
.TP
.B "\'Quit' button"
Quit xpdf.
.PP
.SS Links
Clicking on a hyperlink will jump to the link's destination.
Currently, only links within PDF documents or to another PDF file are
supported.  Clicking on a URL link just prints the URL.  Clicking on
any other type of link (e.g., links to executable programs) prints an
error message.
.PP
.SS Key bindings

.TP
.B q
Quit xpdf.
.SH "WEB BROWSERS"
If you want to run xpdf automatically from netscape or mosaic (and
probably other browsers) when you click on a link to a PDF file, you
need to edit (or create) the files
.I .mime.types
and
.I .mailcap
in your home directory.  In
.I .mime.types
add the line:
.PP
.RS
application/pdf pdf
.RE
.PP
In
.I .mailcap
add the lines:
.PP
.RS
# Use xpdf to view PDF files.
.RE
.RS
application/pdf; xpdf -err %s
.RE
.PP
Make sure that xpdf is on your executable search path.
.SH "REMOTE SERVER MODE"
Xpdf can be started in remote server mode by specifying a server name
(in addition to the file name and page number).  For example:
.PP
.RS
xpdf -remote myServer file.pdf
.RE
.PP
If there is currently no xpdf running in server mode with the name
\'myServer', a new xpdf window will be opened.  If another command:
.PP
.RS
xpdf -remote myServer another.pdf 9
.RE
.PP
is issued, a new copy of xpdf will not be started.  Instead, the first
xpdf (the server) will load
.I another.pdf
and display page nine.  If the file name is the same:
.PP
.RS
xpdf -remote myServer another.pdf 4
.RE
.PP
the xpdf server will simply display the specified page.
.PP
The -raise option tells the server to raise its window; it can be
specified with or without a file name and page number.
.PP
The -quit option tells the server to close its window and exit.
.SH "CONFIGURATION FILE"
Xpdf will read a file called
.I .xpdfrc
from your home directory (if it exists).  This file can contain two
types of entries.
.TP
.BI fontpath " directory"
Look for Type 1 fonts in
.IR directory .
Xpdf uses this only to get the font encoding.  For display, the font
must also be mapped with a
.B fontmap
entry.
.TP
.BI fontmap " PDF-font" "" " X-font"
Map
.I PDF-font
(as referenced in a PDF file) to
.IR X-font ,
which should be a standard X font descriptor with \'%s' in the pixel
size position.
.PP
For example, use:
.PP
.RS
fontmap TimesCE-Roman -*-times-medium-r-*-*-%s-*-*-*-*-*-iso8859-2
.RE
.PP
to map the Central European (Latin-2) version of the Times-Roman
font.  This assumes that you've installed the appropriate X fonts (see
.BR mkfontdir (1)).
Xpdf knows about the ISO8859-2 encoding, so you don't need a
.B fontpath
entry for these fonts.
To use the Bakoma Type 1 fonts, do this:
.PP
.RS
fontpath /home/derekn/fonts/bakoma
.br
fontmap cmb10 -bakoma-cmb10-medium-r-normal--%s-*-*-*-p-*-adobe-fontspecific
.br
fontmap cmbsy10 -bakoma-cmbsy10-medium-r-normal--%s-*-*-*-p-*-adobe-fontspecific
.br
etc...
.RE
.PP
This assumes that the Type 1 font files are available in the directory
.IR /home/derekn/fonts/bakoma .
.SH BUGS
This is a beta release of xpdf, and there are still a bunch of PDF
features which I have yet to implement.
.PP
At this point, the biggest problem is that embedded fonts are not
handled properly.
